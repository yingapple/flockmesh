# FlockMesh v0.1.0

## Summary
FlockMesh v0.1.0 is focused on one-person onboarding, safer runtime policy controls, and stronger actor identity guardrails.

## Highlights
- One-person quickstart
  - Added `POST /v0/quickstart/one-person` to provision agent + binding + first run in one flow.
  - Added idempotent replay behavior for quickstart.
- Starter-first control plane UX
  - Starter flow prioritizes Quickstart + Approval Inbox + Run Feed.
  - Advanced capabilities remain available via Advanced Tools panel.
- Runtime policy context is no longer hardcoded
  - Run creation now resolves policy from explicit `policy_context`, then agent defaults, then system defaults.
- Actor identity guardrails for mutating APIs
  - Mutating routes require `x-flockmesh-actor-id`.
  - Body actor claims must match authenticated actor (`trigger.actor_id`, `approved_by`, `cancelled_by`, `initiated_by`, `owner_id`, `actor_id`).
- Connector adapter hardening
  - Fail-closed behavior for escalation, timeout, rate-limit, and allowlist violations.
  - Better retry and idempotency handling for mutation actions.

## API Changes
- Added support for `policy_context` in run creation request.
- Enforced actor header + claim-match checks on mutating routes.
- Connector adapter `simulate` now requires `initiated_by`.

## Breaking Changes
- Clients calling mutating APIs must send `x-flockmesh-actor-id`.
- Requests with actor claim mismatch now return `403`.

## Verification
- `npm test`: pass (`97/97`)
- `npm run smoke:adapters`: pass
- `npm run spec:check`: pass

## Known Gap
- OpenAPI currently does not fully declare the required actor header across all mutating endpoints. Runtime already enforces it.

## Upgrade Notes
1. Update API client/middleware to always inject `x-flockmesh-actor-id` for mutating routes.
2. Ensure actor fields in payload match the same user id.
3. For adapter simulation calls, include `initiated_by`.
