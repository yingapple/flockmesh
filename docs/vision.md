# Vision: Beyond Chat-Centric Collaboration

## Problem

Current enterprise collaboration products optimize for message flow between people. But execution increasingly happens through software and AI agents. Teams now need a native way to:

- Define agent roles
- Connect agents to internal systems safely
- Coordinate human and agent work in one operational model

## Future Organization Model

A modern organization will have three layers:

1. Human Layer
- Strategic judgment
- Ambiguous decisions
- High-trust approvals

2. Agent Layer
- Repeatable operations
- Monitoring and reaction
- Knowledge retrieval and synthesis

3. System Layer
- Source systems (CRM/ERP/BI/Support)
- Tool contracts and APIs
- Event and state infrastructure

FlockMesh makes these three layers programmable together.

## Design Principles

1. Agent Identity First
Every agent is an addressable org unit with explicit role, permissions, and versioned behavior.

2. Connection as Product
Integrations are not hidden scripts. They are shared, governed contracts.

3. Workflow Over Chat Noise
Communication is attached to tasks, decisions, and outcomes.

4. Policy by Default
No execution without policy checks, least privilege, and traceability.

5. Portable by Standard
Prefer open standards (MCP, A2A) over closed proprietary lock-in.
